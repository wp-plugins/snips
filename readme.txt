Easy snippet/Shortcode editor plugin for Wordpress

== Description ==

Allows to define shortcodes for easy replacement.
Handy for recurrent copy/paste's from sites like YouTube or DailyMotion... But not only. You decide!
Also allows you not to write un-valid tags that would be stripped out by Wordpress (`<object>`s for example)

The syntaxt is Shortcodes' one, but for legacy reasons you can use this syntax :
[key:parameter1,parameter2,parameter3...]

== Installation ==

1. Upload `snips` folder and its content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings/Snips to create/edit shortcodes and use them in your posts
4. Enjoy!
